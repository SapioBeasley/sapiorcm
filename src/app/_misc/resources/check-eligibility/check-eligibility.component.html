      <strong>Description</strong>

      <p>
        <small>**This is to be done before the patient is seen by the doctor!</small>
      </p>

      <p>Along with the customers demographic details you will also need, insurance group number (npi), and the policy
        number. With the exception of the patient's name (if they are not the policy holder) this information is located
        on the insurance card.</p>

      <p>After the insurance provider has been contacted and all requirements have been met, the billing process should
        be explained to the patient. The patient should be informed of services not covered by their insurance plan and
        the out-of-pocket costs of those services. Having all parties understand and agree to their financial
        responsibility ensures the medical billing process will proceed smoothly. Likewise, if the patientâ€™s insurance
        policy includes a copayment, or a small fee collected at the time of the appointment, the patient should be
        informed of the amount they will have to pay. Some offices collect copayments before the patient receives
        medical services.</p>
